## Description

In this repository, I have built a Budget Tracker application utilizing IndexedDb. The main focus of this unit was Progressive Web Applications (PWA's) and this application allows for online/offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
