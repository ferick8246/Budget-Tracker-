## Description

In this repository, I have built a Budget Tracker application utilizing IndexedDb. The main focus of this unit was Progressive Web Applications (PWA's) and this application allows for online/offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Usage

Enter the name and amount for your transaction.
Select whether you are adding or subtracting funds, via the buttons on the right of the form div.
Analyze the graph to see the budget data.
Extra: Open Dev Tools and navigate to the Network and Application tabs to see the insight of your data being called. Additionally, you can set your Network and service worker to offline to see the appliction working without internet access.
